# Old School RuneScape News app

Old School RuneScape is a fantasy MMORPG that has updates to the game posted to the main site linked here: https://oldschool.runescape.com/

This is a simple Python app that reloads that page every minute to check if any of the text on the site (besides constantly changing numbers like player population) have changed. Text on the site changing would indicate an update or news post has been added.

The app sends an e-mail to the target_email variable in the code whenever an update or news post has been added on the main page.

An e-mail username and password needs to also be entered to act as the sending e-mail (username and password variables, respectively).


To run the program you will need to have Python installed as well as various plugins.
